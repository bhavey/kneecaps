I'm using a LAMP stack for this: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

This is all held in /var/www/html

There is a file mysql_auth.php which is not included in the directory. The file mysql_auth_example.php shows the contents of this file. You can copy this file and then change the username and password to reflect what's actually being used.
